  "architectural_notes": [
    "All functionality must be contained in a single index.html (HTML/CSS/JS/assets via inline/base64) with no backend; must run when deployed as static site (e.g., Netlify).",
    "Persist editable configuration in localStorage; optionally override/seed configuration via base64-encoded ?data= query parameter for shareable links.",
    "Audio must start only after explicit user interaction (Tap to Start) and then fade in to comply with browser autoplay policies.",
    "Background music should be replaced using the user-provided \"forever\" audio file (provided as forever.mp4/MP3); integrate in a single-file friendly way (e.g., inline/base64) and still start only after Tap-to-Start with a smooth fade-in."
  ],
  "known_issues": [
    "Background noise/audio is perceived as annoying; needs replacement with a soothing romantic instrumental.",
    "Site needs better optimization for both mobile and PC usage (performance/responsiveness).",
    "Custom names/messages are not applying correctly (e.g., Girlfriend: Filizana, Boyfriend: Akash; plus custom No/Yes messages).",
    "Admin panel shareable base64 link generation is not including the updated settings (encodes stale/default values and/or loaded links don’t reflect recent edits).",
    "No-button evasion movement should jump farther (e.g., to corners/edges like top corner then left corner, etc.) rather than staying near; current behavior doesn’t match desired far-jump pattern.",
    "No button can evade outside the browser window/viewport, becoming invisible and impossible to interact with; must constrain movement to stay fully onscreen."
