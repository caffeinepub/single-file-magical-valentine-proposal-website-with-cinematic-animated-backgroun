  "summary": "The diff provides only truncated HTML/CSS and metadata summaries, so there isn’t enough direct code evidence to verify that the requested No-button repeated evasion logic, 7-evade gating, new romantic instrumental audio with fade-in, and performance optimizations were actually implemented in frontend/index.html. The diff also adds a React App.tsx redirect/loader, which conflicts with the “single-file static page” constraint, and metadata indicates a hidden admin panel that appears out of scope per the non-goals.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-12",
      "requirement": "Fix the “No” button evasion behavior so it reliably evades repeatedly on both desktop and mobile, remains interactive, and stays within the viewport.",
      "reason": "The provided frontend/index.html diff is truncated and shows mostly CSS/structure; it does not include the JS/event-handler logic needed to confirm repeated hover/click/tap evasions, persistent interactivity, or viewport-safe positioning.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/index.html (truncated; no No-button JS behavior shown)"
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-13",
      "requirement": "Ensure the “No” button performs at least 7 evasions before revealing the “Yes” button, consistently on mobile and desktop, without unexpected counter resets.",
      "reason": "No evade counter logic or Yes-button reveal logic is visible in the truncated diff, so the 7-evade requirement and counter stability cannot be confirmed from the provided changes.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/index.html (truncated; no evade counter / reveal logic shown)"

    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-14",
      "requirement": "Replace background audio with a soothing romantic instrumental soundscape; start only after “Tap to Start ✨”; smooth fade-in; comfortable volume; graceful failure if audio cannot start.",
      "reason": "The diff does not show any audio implementation details (e.g., WebAudio nodes, volume defaults, fade-in ramp, error handling). Metadata claims new audio, but the actual code is not present in the truncated snippet.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/index.html (truncated; no audio JS shown)"
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-15",
      "requirement": "Optimize runtime performance/responsiveness for mobile/PC, including animation loops, canvas rendering, efficient resize handling, and preventing unintended scrolling/zooming.",
      "reason": "Only partial CSS is visible (e.g., viewport meta and touch-action settings), but no concrete animation loop/canvas render loop optimizations, resize throttling, or frame-rate control code is shown in the truncated diff.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/index.html (truncated; no canvas/animation optimization JS shown)"

      "description": "Added a React App component that redirects to /index.html and shows a separate loading screen.",
      "reason": "BuildRequest requires keeping the site as a single-file static page in frontend/index.html; adding frontend/src/App.tsx introduces an additional UI entry point and user-facing loading screen not requested.",

        "frontend/src/App.tsx"
      ]
    },
    {
      "description": "Hidden admin panel with localStorage persistence and shareable base64-encoded links.",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest explicitly lists “Adding new features unrelated to the reported bugs (e.g., new admin capabilities…)” as a non-goal; the diff’s summaries describe an admin panel feature.",
