  "summary": "Backend admin verification was updated to use password \"2026edit\". The diff summary asserts frontend fixes (No-button clamping and admin UI repair), but the provided frontend/index.html content is heavily truncated and does not include the relevant JS/logic, so those frontend requirements cannot be verified from the available evidence. Several additional Valentine-page features appear to have been added that were not requested.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Fix the evasive “No” button behavior in `frontend/index.html` so it always remains fully within the visible browser viewport (including after the first move), stays clickable, and continues to evade the cursor for up to 10 moves as intended.",
      "reason": "The diff only shows truncated CSS/HTML for `frontend/index.html` and does not include the JS/positioning logic needed to confirm viewport clamping, clickability after the first move, exactly/up-to 10 evasive moves, or resize/rotation handling.",

      "requirement": "Repair the hidden admin interface in `frontend/index.html` so logging in with username `akash` and password `2026edit` works, and the admin can update the BF name, GF name, and the main message as intended.",
      "reason": "The diff does not show the admin UI/login logic, hidden trigger mechanism, incorrect-credential error messaging, or live-update wiring; `frontend/index.html` is truncated before any relevant script and the change summary is not sufficient to verify implementation.",
