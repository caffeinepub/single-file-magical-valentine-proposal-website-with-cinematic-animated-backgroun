  "summary": "The diff indicates the No-button evasion logic in `frontend/index.html` was updated to clamp positioning within viewport bounds with safe padding and to unify desktop/mobile interaction handling, aiming to ensure 7 evasions before revealing the Yes button. However, the diff also includes an unrelated change to `frontend/src/App.tsx` (redirect behavior) which was not requested and may violate the constraint to implement within the existing single-page `frontend/index.html`.",
